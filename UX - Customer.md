Perspective Customer - Current situation
Carl Customer really likes going to restaurants, so he this evening goes to one. He stands in the entrance
area and waits until the waitress comes to Carl and shows him a free table and then disappears, because
the restaurant is full. Then he needs to wait some more, in order to get the menu. He then tries
to read it, but it is in german and he is from France, and there are no pictures, that shows him,
how the food will look like. Despite that, he decides very quickly what to eat, but still has to wait for
the waitress, because she doesn't see him or is busy. After ordering and waiting, he finally gets
his food, it tasted nice. He then remembered that he wanted to try a dessert, but the waitress
already took the menu away, so he needs again try to get her attention. After he got the menu and
deciding, which he did very quickly, so the waitress didn't have any chance to run away. After the dessert
has been brought to Carl and he has eaten, he wants to pay, so he needs to get the waitress attention again.
Carl first wanted to pay by credit card, but the waitress told him that this is not possible, so he
needs to use cash. He pays and then leaves.

to him. Finally, after he finished eating, he pays using the app and leaves.
